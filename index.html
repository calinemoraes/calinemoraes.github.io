        <h2>2025 • Payment profile (coming soon)</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Managing payment methods was only possible at checkout, causing errors and frustration and disrupting the ordering experience. Subscription management lacked clear entry points, making it harder for users to update payment details. Without a structured approach, users struggled with trust, security, and accessibility in handling their payments.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>We are designing a seamless, intuitive Payment profile that gives users better control over their payment methods while setting the stage for future financial interactions. Through ongoing research and iteration, we aim to improve usability, trust, and scalability while aligning with industry standards.</p>
        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Reduce friction and checkout errors</li>
          <li>Improve user experience and retention</li>
          <li>Increase trust and payment flexibility</li>
          <li>Scalable foundation for future financial services</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2024 • Encouraging cost-effective payment methods</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Users can select various payment methods at checkout, but they often default to familiar options, even when more cost-effective alternatives are available. Some payment methods have significantly higher processing fees, increasing costs for the business. Without clear guidance, users miss opportunities to choose better options, leading to unnecessary expenses.</p>
         <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>We are refining the checkout experience to promote smarter payment choices by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reordering payment options to highlight cost-effective methods</li>
          <li>Preselecting the most efficient payment method for new and returning users</li>
          <li>Displaying transaction fees to provide transparency</li>
          <li>Introducing quick-select features for a seamless experience</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Reduce operational costs by shifting users toward lower-fee payment methods</li>
          <li>Improve payment success rates by ensuring a smoother, more informed selection process</li>
          <li>Increase transparency and trust by showing users the cost implications of their choices</li>
          <li>Optimise user experience with minimal friction while encouraging better payment behaviours </li>
          <li>Long-term scalability with backend-driven configurations to adapt as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2024 • Enhancing media content in the order journey</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Customers feel more confident and make faster decisions when they have access to rich media content about dishes and restaurants. However, our platform currently lacks sufficient media integration throughout the discovery journey, limiting engagement and impacting conversion rates. Balancing this opportunity with technical constraints is key to delivering an improved experience.</p>
         <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>We explored ways to seamlessly integrate more media content into the discovery and ordering journey while maintaining a frictionless experience. By aligning with industry standards and optimising content placement, we aim to enhance user confidence, excitement, and decision-making.</p>
        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Increase SERP-to-menu conversions</li>
          <li>Higher order conversion and average order value</li>
          <li>Improve customer confidence and satisfaction</li>
          <li>More relevant and engaging content for users</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2023 • Individual ordering</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Several enterprise customers in the sales pipeline highlighted a critical requirement: their employees, referred to as "Eaters," needed the ability to order food for dinner on an ad hoc basis. These employees required the flexibility to use their daily allowance to order food to their office anytime in the evening, without being restricted to set delivery windows. The inability to provide this seamless on-demand ordering service was a significant barrier preventing Just Eat for Business (JEFB) from securing deals with numerous enterprise clients.
</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>To address these needs, the proposal was to leverage the existing Just Eat platform to handle the placement and delivery of these ad hoc orders while maintaining all corporate controls within the JEFB platform. This integration aimed to provide significant value against the enterprise's strategic pillar, enhancing the overall business offering and enabling JEFB to attract and secure a broader range of customers.</p>
